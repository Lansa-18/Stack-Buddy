## Description

Stack-Buddy is a Discord bot that provides various functionalities to help stackies on the StackUp platform. It can fetch user details, display a calendar of events, and more.

## Why Stack Buddy
As a stackie, getting information such as personal user details, campaigns, events, and much more happens on the StackUp website. This means whenever you need such information, you have to log on to the site. 90% of the time, that's stressful... I know, I said it, stressful. Do I really have to log on to the site every time I need this information?
However, with **Stack Buddy**, you get to access all that information right in the Discord Community. I know, right? It's much less stressful! Stack Buddy brings the StackUp platform to your very doorstep.
Now you can check your balance, view active campaigns, see upcoming hackathons, and more - all without leaving Discord. **You're Welcome!!**
